# Contributing

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need students, volunteers and contributors (at all level!) to help this project come to fruition.
To familiar yourself with the open source eco-system and how you can help projects, please have a first look at <https://opensource.guide/>.

## How to Contribute

If you want to learn markdown, which is the language used to write those notes, refer to e.g. <https://commonmark.org/help/>.

## What to Contribute

### Did You Find a Bug, Mistake, or Typo?

### Do You Have a Question About the Source Code?

### Suggestions

Please refer to [`KNOWN_BUGS.md`](KNOWN_BUGS.html) for a list of known bugs.

## Guidelines

### Text

- Titles are capitalized using the Chicago Manual:

> - Capitalize the first and the last word.
> - Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions.
> - Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions.
> - Lowercase the ‘to’ in an infinitive (I want to play guitar).

- Please, keep in mind that, as [@knuth1989mathematical, p. 19] writes:
    
    > Exercises are some of the most difficult parts of a book to write. Since an exercise has very little context, ambiguity can be especially deadly; a bit of carefully chosen redundancy can be especially important.

    
### Code

#### Java 

Types of comments:

#. Documentation comments- These describe classes, methods, content, etc. Usually placed before declarations.

    ```{.java}
    /**
    * Documentation  
    * Comment
    */
    ```

#. Single line comments

    ```{.java}
    // Comment
    ```

#. Multi-line comments 

    ```{.java}
    /*
    * Comment
    * Continued
    */
    ```
