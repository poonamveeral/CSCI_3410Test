- Fill the line "List all the entity integrity constraint and referential integrity constraint." with the actual constraints.
 
- Check that the title of the problems are *not* capitalized.
 
- Check that the numbering (and order) of the solution of the exercises and problems match the numbering of the exercises and problems.

- Look for arguments to help us decide if we should write "S.Q.L.", "U.M.L." and "E.R.", or "SQL", "UML" and "ER".

- Replace all the abbreviations (don't, won't, can't, etc.) with their "expanded" version (do not, will not, cannot, etc.)?

- Remove all the occurences of "I".

- Every time a problem is separated in questions, organize the solutions accordingly. So, do something like

> Solution to Problem 1.1 (A database catalog for a campus)
>    Pb 1.1 – Solution to Q. 1
>    …
>    Pb 1.1 – Solution to Q. 2

Ideally, all the problems would be separated in questions.

- Add "Jump to solution" to every problem?
